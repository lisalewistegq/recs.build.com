<p>Shafaq News / The Iraqi Parliament&#8217;s Agriculture and Water Committee announced on Monday that the Canadian government has provided a grant of over $3.7 million to revitalize the marshlands in the southern provinces and protect them from climate change impacts.</p>
<p>Committee member Ibtisam Al-Hilali told Shafaq News Agency, &#8220;the Canadian government has granted Iraq $3.7 million to revitalize the marshlands in the southern provinces, particularly the Al-Jabayish marshes in Dhi Qar Province.&#8221;</p>
<p>Al-Hilali added, &#8220;the Canadian grant is part of the Iraqi Marshlands Revitalization project, which includes improving the living conditions for rural inhabitants, providing clean drinking water, developing livestock, and preventing illegal fishing in the marshes and the southern regions of Iraq.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also noted, &#8220;the project aims to achieve several objectives, including the protection of the marshlands and their global heritage from drought and climate change effects, providing clean drinking water to the marshland residents by establishing desalination projects to supply freshwater, and protecting the wildlife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The marshlands in southern Iraq have been facing a significant humanitarian and environmental crisis due to water scarcity. There are warnings of a fate similar to the massive marshland drying that occurred in the 1990s, which threatens agricultural, fishery, and wildlife resources in the region.</p>
<p>These areas have experienced severe drought this year due to reduced rainfall during the past winter season, exacerbated by neighboring countries&#8217; encroachments on Iraq&#8217;s water shares and the closure of tributaries of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that originate from their territories.</p>

<p>Shafaq News / The Gulf Cooperation Council foreign ministers issued a statement on Monday regarding the Iraqi judiciary&#8217;s decision regarding the Khawr Abd Allah agreement, describing it as &#8220;inaccurate and out of context.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement was released after the coordination meeting of the Ministerial Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in New York, attended by the foreign ministers of the Gulf Arab states.</p>
<p>The council discussed current developments with the Republic of Iraq, calling on Iraq to take serious and urgent steps to address the negative effects of these developments, which resulted from the ruling of the Federal Supreme Court issued on Monday, September 4, 2023, and published on Thursday, September 14, 2023.</p>
<p>The ruling contained historically inaccurate and contextually irrelevant elements regarding the 2012 agreement between Kuwait and Iraq concerning the regulation of maritime navigation in Khawr Abd Allah, which was ratified by the Iraqi side in 2013 and deposited with the United Nations.</p>
<p>The Ministerial Council affirmed that these developments do not serve the relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and violate international charters, treaties, and agreements, including the Security Council resolution.</p>
<p>Kuwait initiated international efforts in New York to discuss the maritime navigation agreement issue with senior officials from the United States and the United Nations. The Kuwaiti Ministry of Foreign Affairs had delivered a protest memorandum to the Iraqi Ambassador to Kuwait regarding the Federal Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling on the maritime navigation regulation agreement in Khawr Abd Allah.</p>
<p>The Federal Supreme Court (the highest judicial authority in Iraq) ruled on the fourth of September of this year, declaring the unconstitutionality of the law approving the maritime navigation agreement in Khawr Abd Allah with Kuwait.</p>

<p>Shafaq News / The Kuwaiti government has initiated international efforts in New York to discuss the issue of the maritime navigation agreement with senior officials from the United States and the United Nations.</p>
<p>Sources informed the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Rai that Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, began a short visit to New York with the main goal of addressing this issue.</p>
<p>During his visit, he met with Barbara Leaf, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, and discussed the close bilateral relations and strategic cooperation between Kuwait and the United States.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the meeting covered recent developments in the region, particularly regarding the judgments issued by the Federal Supreme Court of Iraq regarding the maritime navigation agreement between the governments of Kuwait and Iraq concerning the regulation of maritime navigation in the Khawr Abd Allah, an agreement ratified by both countries and deposited with the United Nations.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that &#8220;Kuwait&#8217;s diplomatic efforts will involve discussions with several senior officials from international organizations, the United States, and European countries, especially since the Iraqi judiciary has deemed the agreement unconstitutional. It was approved by the Iraqi parliament under Law No. 42 of 2013 and by the Kuwaiti National Assembly under Law No. 4 of 2013, with its deposit at the United Nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sources also indicated that the Foreign Minister would address this issue with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) group within the United Nations as part of unified Gulf coordination on this matter.</p>
<p>This comes as the GCC ministerial council recently expressed its firm rejection of any violation of Kuwait&#8217;s sovereignty and its determination to respond within legal channels. It also called on Iraq to respect Kuwait&#8217;s sovereignty and not violate international resolutions and agreements. </p>
<p>The Kuwaiti Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously handed a protest memorandum to the Iraqi Ambassador to Kuwait regarding the Federal Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling on the regulation of maritime navigation in Khawr Abd Allah.</p>

<p>Shafaq News / Gold prices were flat on Monday as investors continued to price in a pause in interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve at their policy meeting this week with a focus on the U.S central bankâs rate outlook.</p>
<p>Spot gold was listless at $1,924.29 per ounce by 0056 GMT. U.S. gold futures steadied at $1,946.10.</p>
<p>Asian shares started trade cautiously on Monday in a week packed with central bank meetings, which will be closely scrutinised for the global interest rate outlook.</p>
<p>Faster growth, cooler inflation and a job market that wonât quit have set the stage for an updated batch of forecasts from Fed officials this week likely to reflect their growing faith in prospects for an economic soft landing.</p>
<p>The Bank of England is likely to hike interest rates once again this week, possibly the last hurrah for one of the great tightening cycles of the last 100 years as a cooling economy begins to worry policymakers.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japanâs policy meeting on Friday is the highlight of the week in Asia.</p>
<p>U.S. manufacturing output barely rose in August amid a decline in motor vehicle production, and activity could contract in the months ahead after the United Auto Workers (UAW) union embarked on strikes at three factories on Friday.</p>
