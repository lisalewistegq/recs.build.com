There are warnings of a fate similar to the massive marshland drying that occurred in the 1990s, which threatens agricultural, fishery, and wildlife resources in the region.<\/p>\n<p>These areas have experienced severe drought this year due to reduced rainfall during the past winter season, exacerbated by neighboring countries&#8217; encroachments on Iraq&#8217;s water shares and the closure of tributaries of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that originate from their territories.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><script async defer crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_GB\/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v13.0\" nonce=\"vvWczoA8\" type=\"7c902466a39d2c8617fa42e8-text\/javascript\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Canada grants $3 million to revitalize Iraq&#8217;s marshlands Canada grants $3 million to revitalize Iraq&#8217;s marshlands 2023\/09\/18 | 13:15 &#8211; Source: Shafaq News Shafaq News \/ The Iraqi Parliament&#8217;s Agriculture and Water Committee announced on Monday that the Canadian government has provided a grant of over $3.7 million to revitalize the marshlands in the southern &#8230; <a title=\"Canada grants $3 million to revitalize Iraq&#8217;s marshlands\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/canada-grants-3-million-to-revitalize-iraqs-marshlands\/\" aria-label=\"More on Canada grants $3 million to revitalize Iraq&#8217;s marshlands\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1076,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1075"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1075"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1075\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1077,"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1075\/revisions\/1077"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1076"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1075"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1075"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/news.cnbcnews24.live\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1075"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
